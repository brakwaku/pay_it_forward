    <h4>Our Story</h4>
      <p>
        International students, seeking opportunities that their home countries
        do not offer, often face dreadful financial crises and a lack of
        orientation at some point during their studies. Sometimes they even
        missed one-time opportunities due to a lack of resources. Ongoing Help
        focuses on providing mentorship on orientation, self-reliance, and
        financial aid to international students in the United States. Making
        their dream a reality is our way of paying it forward every chance we
        get.

        Our mentorship program will provide a home away from home. Our
        volunteers who have gone through this process will be available to offer
        guidance, answer questions, and assist in the direction needed.
        Furthermore, one of the most important aids we provide is self-reliance.
        Learning how to find employment and apply for a social security number,
        stick to a budget to be able to save money for the future semesters is
        what we aim in counselling. Last, we offer financial assistance for
        tuition, school supplies, and housing to those who need it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through our personal journey, we have received countless support, and to
        compensate we give our complete self, effort, and resources to advocate
        and make it happen for the applicants. Showing them the path, and
        teaching them self-reliance to create a life for themselves and to bring
        hope to their communities is our objective.
