        <strong className='h2'>T</strong>he difference between successfully going through the
        process of attending university or college in the United States or
        having a poor experience is doing your own research. For example,
        finding a university is the first step. Choosing one that is close to
        family or friends in the States will probably brighten the journey. The
        next steps are:

          <strong className='h2'>A</strong>fter being accepted by a school, the following
          process is applying for a student visa. Since qualifying for a student
          visa is a courtesy, giving oneself the best shot may be the only hope.
          As a result of providing assistance to applicants in different
          countries, we have learned that each region comes with its
          difficulties. For instance, the social-political situation of your
          home country and your financial situation contribute to determining
          the probability of being granted a visa. Considering we are a
          faith-friendly organization, we believe Heavenly Father will provide
          and make miracles if thatâ€™s His plan.
